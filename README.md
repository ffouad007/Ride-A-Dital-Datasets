# Ride-A-Dital project

The original dataset download location: https://www.kaggle.com/c/new-york-city-taxi-fare-prediction/data?select=train.csv
The dataset size is 5.5 GB. You can run the simulation for dataset using AverageCase.ipynb but it will take very long time to load the data. Thus, We generate subsets from the orginal dataset with smaller size to be use in simualtion as the following:

1. df_friday.csv
2. df_monday.csv
3. df_sunday.csv
4. df_wednesday.csv

To run the simulation for the above subdatesets, please click the following link to run the code in https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1SiXaudKmgd-IGtU0niKCcdsnA9ApuXYz?usp=sharing. An invitation was sent to your email to give access the simualtion code. Please accept the invitation to be able to run the code.
