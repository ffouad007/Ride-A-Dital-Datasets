# Online Uber Problem project

This project contains the raw .ipynb (AverageCase.ipynb) file we used to perform data prep and run the simulations. You can gladly run that file (it contains its own readme within the file). However, due to the original dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/c/new-york-city-taxi-fare-prediction/data?select=train.csv) needing to be downloaded and being quite large (5.7GB) we have created a more simple method for you to run the simulations if you want. In this project there are four subset csv files which we use in our simulations and are derived from the larger original dataset:

1. df_friday.csv
2. df_monday.csv
3. df_sunday.csv
4. df_wednesday.csv

To run only the simulations on the above subdatesets, without running the data prep code, please click the following link to run the code in Google Collab https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1SiXaudKmgd-IGtU0niKCcdsnA9ApuXYz?usp=sharing. This also allows for easy running of the code without the need to use Jupyter or Python 3 if you don't often. An invitation was sent to your email to give access the simualtion code. Please accept the invitation to be able to run the code, and let us know if there are any problems that arise.
